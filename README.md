#### Profile

I'm a full-stack software engineer and former Oxford music student who took the plunge: abandoning academia to learn how to code at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). My personal obsession with software and machines is finally becoming a professional one. Fascinated by clean code, efficient collaboration, new technologies, and above all new knowledge. 

## Projects<a name="projects"></a>    

| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies | Testing |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [The Shallot](https://github.com/jebax/TheShallotSummary) | With only a weekend to create a front-end, single-page app, and with zero frameworks allowed on top of pure JS, I created my own testing framework to test drive The Shallot - an unoriginally named news summary app with unoriginal content (but the code is nice). | 3 days | JavaScript, HTML/CSS | Custom framework |
| [AceBook](https://github.com/chloeverity/acebook-breakfast-club) | This Facebook clone was created in 2 weeks while we learned Rails for the very first time. My first opportunity to use fully developed Agile principles in a time pressured environment. | 10 days | Ruby on Rails, CoffeeScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), AWS EB | RSpec, Capybara, Selenium Webdriver  |

## Skills<a name="skills"></a>

#### Clean Code Advocate

Studying at Makers left me with a desire to write beautifully crafted code. I take pride in my attention to detail, always striving to build the highest quality codebase possible, and I work towards this goal by observing SOLID principles, implementing Agile methodologies such as XP and Scrum, and using TDD/BDD. For example, I ensured that our [AceBook](https://github.com/chloeverity/acebook-breakfast-club) team took time to fully test-drive every feature, even when we were dealing with unfamiliar technologies we had little knowledge of. This paid off when errors started appearing in unexpected areas of our app. I now look forward to completing projects in a team that appreciates these values and methodologies as much as I do.

#### Proficient Debugger

Drawing connections, spotting patterns, and isolating routes for problem solving are some of my strongest personal assets. While at Makers, these skils translated into sharp debugging abilities, and I was often the go-to student in my cohort for debugging assistance. During the [AceBook](https://github.com/chloeverity/acebook-breakfast-club) project we had a persistent bug with parameter submission while attempting to implement live chat functionality. With time running short before the end of our sprint and the deadline for implementation, I was able to isolate and resolve the issue, rooted in an interaction between our CoffeeScript code and our HTML. Definitely one of my most satisfying 'a-ha' moments while coding.

#### Knowledge Acquisition & Training

I'm able to pick up new concepts at lightning speed, then distill information into its crucial elements in order to help others. This became particularly useful during my time as a diabetes Patient Coordinator. A newly introduced patient data management system left many of my colleagues struggling to keep up with new methods for storing, sorting, and retrieving data - meaning low productivity and frustrated patients. I got to grips with the new system far ahead of anyone else, giving me the opportunity to train and assist others. My time spent training other colleagues helped us to regain our momentum as a team and stay on top of patients' needs.
