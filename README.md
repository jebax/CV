#### Profile

I'm a former Oxford music student who's taken the plunge: abandoning academia to learn code at Makers Academy. I'm finally translating my personal obsession with software and machines into a professional one.

After a year of teaching myself to code while working as a diabetes Patient Coordinator, I applied to Makers because I'm fuelled by knowledge, and I had a desire to learn so much more. I'm now interested in a role that will give me the opportunity to extend my programming knowledge, work with a brilliant team of like-minded developers, and become part of the future.

## Skills<a name="skills"></a>

#### Analysis

Drawing connections, spotting patterns, and isolating routes for problem solving are some of my strongest personal assets. When I was working as a diabetes Patient Coordinator, a new system for patient data management was introduced without being fully completed. The live system was therefore rather basic, and the software had a large number of bugs. Despite not working on the data team, my day-to-day contact with this system, combined with my ability to isolate the steps required to recreate these bugs, meant that I became a key asset to the data team in identifying root causes of these issues. My assistance in this field lead to the swift resolution of many of the bugs, and the system then became fully operational within two weeks.

#### Delivery

My ability to work under pressure and deliver excellent results to tight deadlines is particularly strong, and was tested during the second term of my final year of study at university. I took the lead on organising a *Disco Ma Non Troppo* event (see below), all while completing 2 essays per week on my history topics and finishing my dissertation. I managed this intense workload by devising a strict timetable for work and event management, which split up my time efficiently, and by allocating smaller tasks for the event to the others that I organised it with. This efficient work schedule allowed me to balance these two areas of work successfully - my dissertation was one of the highest marked in my year, and the event was a complete sell-out with 660 tickets sold.

#### Knowledge Acquisition & Training

One of my standout skills is picking up new concepts at high speed, and then distilling large amounts of information into its crucial elements, with a view to helping others. This became particularly useful during my time as a diabetes Patient Coordinator. The deployment of a new patient data management system left many of my colleagues struggling to keep up with new methods for storing, sorting, and retrieving data, resulting in temporary low productivity and frustrated patients. I got to grips with the new system far ahead of anyone else, which gave me the opportunity to train and assist others. My time spent training other colleagues helped us to regain our momentum as a team and stay on top of patients' needs.
