## Joel Baxter

#### Profile

I'm a former Oxford music student who has abandoned academia in favour of learning to code at Makers Academy. In doing so I'm finally translating my obsession with tech from the personal to the professional, and kickstarting my career as a full stack developer.

Iâ€™m lightning quick at learning new technologies and concepts, and my strong analytical skills give me great confidence to face challenges and solve complex problems in unfamiliar environments. While my coding knowledge is still in its early stages, I'm already incredibly excited to join a brilliant team of like-minded developers, so I can continue my learning process for many years to come.
