#### Profile

I'm a former Oxford music student who's taken the plunge: abandoning academia in favour of learning to code at Makers Academy. I'm now finally transmuting my personal obsession with tech into a professional one, and kickstarting my career as a full stack developer.

As shown in my experience working as a diabetes Patient Coordinator, Iâ€™m fast and efficient when it comes to learning new technologies and concepts; learning to code at Makers is now giving me the opportunity to apply this skill to understanding the vast and fascinating world of software. While my coding knowledge is still in its early stages, I'm already incredibly excited to join a brilliant team of like-minded developers, so that I can continue my development and apply my newfound knowledge.
